- [ ] Who's in?
  - [x] When an exchange is started the bot should ask "who's in?" and provide an emoji react
  - (stretch) Anyone who reacts to the emoji should have their name show up in the "who's in?" message
  - There should be a time limit on being able to join the exchange (stretch)
    - the bot should ask for a time limit
    - the bot should default the time limit to 24 hours
  - (stretch) Give an id to use to look up a specific exchange using uuid-readable (https://github.com/Debdut/uuid-readable)
  - (stretch) Say the current phase and prompt user to make sure they're sure they want to progress
- [ ] Collecting playlists
  - [x] exchange progress when someone messages /progress-exchange
  - (stretch) Players can send the bot a song and Bot creates a message with everyone's songs
    - Idea: people send their playlist songs to the bot? Which then updates a pinned message with all the playlist songs so far, like Collin's doc
    - Format:
      - Name, list of songs
  - [x] bot sends a message to all the players with their assigned person
  - [x] Bot messages the channel saying "Assignments sent to [x]", where x is everyone who signed up
  - [x] Bot says how long people have to submit songs (value is configured through environment variables, but defaults to 1 week)
    - (Stretch) time is configurable
  - [x] Bot reminds people that the exchange will end 24 hours before it ends
    - (stretch) a person can extend the exchange for another 24 hours with /extend-exchange
- [ ] The reveal
  - When the exchange ends the bot will tag people to say who their playlist was made by
- [ ] Post reveal (Stretch)
  - Bot asks everyone for their top songs
  - Bot creates a playlist of the top songs
- [ ] Alpha release
  - Add database support
  - [x] update bot image
  - Add bot to server
  - Add server id to places where slash commands are updated
  - support changing the loaded environment variable file through the environment
  - Use fanciful names for custom exchange names
